***Version Control System (VCS)*** - program or set of programs that tracks changes to a collection of files. Allows team members to work on a project at the same time without affecting each others work as well as to easily recall earlier versions of individual files or the entire project.

1. You can see all the changes made to the project, when they were made, and who made them.
2. Include a message with each change to explain the reasoning behind it.
3. Retrieve past versions of the entire project or individual files.
4. Create branches, which allows several different sets of changes to be worked on at the same time, without affecting the main branch. Branches can be merged if you'd like to keep wanted changes.
5. Attach a tag to a version - for example, to mark a new release.

***Distributed Version Control*** - allows for project's complete history to be stored on both the client and on the server. Files can be edited without a network connection, checked locally and synced with the server when a connection becomes available.
