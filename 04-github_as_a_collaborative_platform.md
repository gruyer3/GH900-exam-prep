***Issues*** - used to track ideas, feedback, tasks, or bugs for work on GitHub. They can be created from:
- repository
- item in a task list
- note in a project
- comment in an issue or pull request
- specific line of code
- URL query

***Discussions*** - designed for conversations that aren't necessarily tied to code. They support open, ongoing communication within a shared forum and can be public or private, depending on repository's visibility.

***Discussions categories:***
- ***Announcements***:
	- Updates and news from projects maintainers
- ***General:***
	- Anything and everything relevant to the project
- ***Ideas:***
	- Ideas to change or improve the project
- ***Polls:***
	- Polls with multiple options to vote for and discuss
- ***Q&A:***
	- Questions for the community to answer
- ***Show and tell:***
	- Creations, experiments or tests relevant to the project

In a Q&A style discussion, comments can be marked as the accepted answers.
If a discussion leads to work that needs to be tracked, it can be converted into an issue.
Important discussions can be pinned to the top of Discussions page for better visibility.
